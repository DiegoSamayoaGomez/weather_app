# WEATHER APP

This project involves building a weather forecast website using the Visual Crossing API. The app allows users to search for weather information based on a specific location and toggle between Fahrenheit or Celsius temperature units. 

## API Keys
Since this project uses a public API key, I imported it. 
Never expose your API key in the frontend code. 

## The application shows:

- Weather information for a specific location

- Toggle options between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature display

- Dynamic background color or images reflecting the current weather (e.g., cold, hot)

- Show weather information by date, location and time zone

# How to use
 - Go to [WEATHER APP](https://diegosamayoagomez.github.io/weather_app/)
 - Put a location and press the search button
