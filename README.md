# scripts

- npm run build => npx webpack
- npm run dev => npx webpack serve
- npm run deploy => git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages

## remember to run

npm init @eslint/config

I didnÂ´t set a configuration in the template so it can be changed in the future

After running the command mentioned above run
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
